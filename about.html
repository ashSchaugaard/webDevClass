    <h1>This is me</h1>
    <p>I have been designing things since childhood. Anything from Pocahontas cardboard cutouts to elaborate treasure maps leading to my buried pennies.  I thoroughly enjoy the full immersion into creativity and use that focus to create anything from business cards to social media posts. I am addicted to learning and LOVE finding creative solutions to any and all problems that cross my path. Outside of the computer, you will typically find me adventuring with my family, running, or inhaling the outdoors.
